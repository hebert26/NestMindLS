## Getting Started
**Q: How do I add a bookmark or video?**  
A: Paste a URL or use the iOS Share Sheet from Safari or YouTube.

**Q: What are “Threads”?**  
A: Threads group your todos, bookmarks, and videos into one journey.

## Sync (iCloud / CloudKit)
**Q: What happens if I enable CloudKit after I already have local data?**  
A: Existing items will sync to your iCloud. The first sync may take time; keep the app open.  

**Q: I enabled sync but don’t see my items on another device.**  
A: Make sure you’re signed into the same Apple ID, iCloud Drive is enabled, and NestMind has iCloud permission.

---

## Assistant
**Q: Does the Assistant send my data to servers?**  
A: No. It runs on-device. If a feature ever requires network access, you’ll be notified first.

---

## Known Issues
- Initial iCloud sync may be slow for large libraries. Keep the app in the foreground until complete.
